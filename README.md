# next-react-boiler
I was getting tired of configuring my nextjs code env ¯\_(ツ)_/¯, so I decided to create a small repo that will have:
1. NextJS
2. React Scripts
3. Prettier & ESLint config

All the core components are setup and ready to use.

## How to use
Before cloning please be generous. Star & Fork my repo ^.^
1. Clone or Download repo
2. npm install
3. npm start
4. enjoy
